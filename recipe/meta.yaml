  patches:
    # version 0.5.4 brings in tbb as a dependency, but installing it is not
    # seen by pip and pip check will fail.
    # It seems that at the end it is an optional dependency
    # see here: https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/issues/1060#issuecomment-1749511918
    # Therefore, we remove it from the dependencies

  summary: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
  description: |
    umap-learn provides the UMAP manifold based dimension reduction
    algorithm. The package provides an sklearn compatible interface
    to t-SNE like dimension reduction technique that has better
    runtime performacne than t-SNE and often preserves more global
    structure than t-SNE.
